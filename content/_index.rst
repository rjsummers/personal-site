I'm currently a master's student studying electrical engineering at the
University of Oklahoma. My primary research interests are in RF and microwave
engineering, especially microwave remote sensing systems.

I hope to use this website to write about cool stuff when time permits, such
as random microwave components I design in my free time or signal processing
stuff that I think is cool.

It can be seen that this website is still in its infancy, but I hope to flesh
it out with more content in the coming months.
